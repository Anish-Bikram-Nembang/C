# Grokking Algorithms - My Takes (C Implementations)
---
This directory contains my C implementations of algorithms presented in:
> **Grokking Algorithms - Aditya Bhargava**

The book uses Python for examples, but all algorithms here are reimplemented in **C** to deepen understanding of:

- data structures at a low level
- memory layout
- manual implementation details
---
# Compilation
Most programs should compile normally with:-
```bash
gcc algorithm.c -o algorithm
